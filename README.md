# :sparkles: What is Pipex?

This short individual project allowed me to explore the concept of Forks in programming and gain a deeper understanding of their functionality. The focus of the project was to implement the bash pipe '|' in a programming language.

By developing this implementation, I honed my skills in process management and inter-process communication. This project provided valuable hands-on experience in working with Forks and understanding their role in executing commands and managing data flow through the pipe symbol.

Overall, this project was an opportunity for me to expand my knowledge of programming concepts and further develop my skills in process handling and communication.
